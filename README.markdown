MacGoggles
=======================================

Google has a nice tool called Mail Goggles (http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-in-labs-stop-sending-mail-you-later.html) that helps you avoid sending drunk emails. But what about impaired Tweets, Statuses, or, god-forbid, Google+ posts? MacGoggles uses an attached breathalyzer to make sure you know better than to get online late on a Friday night.

You need:
 * A Mac
 * An Arduino
 * An MQ-3 alcohol gas sensor
 * 2 10K ohm resistors
 * 1 3K ohm resistor
 * A MOSFET transistor capable of handling up to 750mA (I use the IRF510, available at RadioShack)
 * 1 0.33 µF capacitor
 * 1 0.1 µF capacitor
 * 1 switch
 * 1 9V battery
 * Lots of wire

The XCode project also makes use of the Mataduino libary, available here: http://appsforarduino.com/matatino/
