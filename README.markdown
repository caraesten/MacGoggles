MacGoggles
=======================================

Google has a nice tool called Mail Goggles (http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/new-in-labs-stop-sending-mail-you-later.html) that helps you avoid sending drunk emails. But what about impaired Tweets, Statuses, or, god-forbid, Google+ posts? MacGoggles uses an attached breathalyzer to make sure you know better than to get online late on a Friday night.
